Overview
The game is like "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"
• During each game, the player is asked 5 questions randomly selected from the base and
not repeated during one game. For each question there are possible answer options (n
number) and only one of them is correct. When the player chooses one of the answer
options, the system informs about the problem being right or wrong.
• Each question has its corresponding point. (for example, according to its complexity). If
the answer is correct, the point for the given question is added to the points calculated for
the given game, and each question can have 5-20 points. In case of an incorrect answer, the
points are not added and the player is notified about the correct answer.
• At the end of the game, the player is shown the number of points he has collected. This is
the main problem where you need to manually add data to the Database; the content of the
questions, of course, is not essential.
